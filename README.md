# NER_workshop
Workshop on entity extraction from literary texts. Run in collaboration by Matthew Wilkens and Ross Deans Kristensen-McLachlan.

We <i>strongly</i> advise participants to access the notebook for this workshop via Google Collab. You can access it via the following link (Google account required):

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dNX5M1wfBgd5GAKk48oqvs-ZiN071ZGm

If you would rather run the notebook locally, please clone this repo and run Jupyter notebooks as you normally would. If you choose this option, be aware that you'll need Python3 and the most recent versions of the following pacakges.

- googlemaps
- plotly
- geocoder
- pandas
- spaCy
- spaCy's English language model (python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_sm)

Lastly, regardless of whether you run the notebook on Google Collab or remotely you <i>must</i> sign up for an API key from MapQuest before the workshop begins. We would also recommend that you sign up for a free API key for Google Places. You will require a billing account for this - in case you go over their fair use limits. But don't worry, you won't be charged during this workshop!
